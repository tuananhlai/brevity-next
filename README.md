# Brevity Next

This project aims to be a production-ready template for my future attempts at building a frontend React. The codebase should have the following features:

- [ ] Comprehensive list of pre-built components.
- [ ] The components must be accessible and support light/dark theme.
- [ ] The components must have sensible API.
- [ ] Use technology as close to core technology as possible. That means no Tailwind.
- [ ] Automated code quality checks using linter and code formatter.
- [ ] Automated code boilerplate generation for better consistency.
- [ ] Automated deployments.
- [ ] Automated tracking of application bundle size, lighthouse performance and code coverage.
- [ ] Has sufficient unit test coverage. The more a component is used, the more important for it to have unit tests.
- [ ] Incorporated visual regression testing using tools like Storybook and Chromatic.
- [ ] Have extensible and maintainable project structure and application architecture. (Bulletproof React)
- [ ] Follow best practices for security.
- [ ] Have small animation that helps the application feel more dynamic and natural.
- [ ] Semantic HTML.
- [ ] Extendable and easy to understand error handling mechanism. (ErrorBoundary, API error, ...)
- [ ] Optimized invocation of remote API (utilize React-Query or something).
- [ ] Integrate with OpenTelemetry / a monitoring solution.
