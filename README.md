Application checklist
- [x] Comprehensive list of pre-built components.
- [x] The components must be accessible and support light/dark theme.
- [x] The components must have sensible API.
- [x] Use technology as close to core technology as possible. That means no Tailwind.

- [x] Automated code boilerplate generation for better consistency.
- [x] Automated deployments.
- [x] Automated tracking of application bundle size, lighthouse performance and code coverage.
- [x] Has sufficient unit test coverage. The more a component is used, the more important for it to have unit tests.
